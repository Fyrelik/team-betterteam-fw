# **Firmware Security Findings**

This document consolidates analysis results from three firmware images examined during the ThanosTech LLC firmware security assessment.  
Each section summarizes critical issues, supporting evidence, and practical mitigations.

---

## **1. TP-Link TL-WR841N**

### **Top Five Findings**
1. Static root password defined in `/etc/init.d/S50telnet`.  
2. Outdated service scripts referencing Telnet and HTTP daemons.  
3. BusyBox v1.37.0 with two known CVEs (CVE-2024-58251, CVE-2025-46394).  
4. Web interface present in `/www` (potential surface for XSS / CSRF).  
5. Minimal build hygiene concerns—no embedded keys or developer traces.

---

### **Detailed Findings**

#### **1. Hard-coded Root Password**
**Evidence**
```bash
echo "root:$1$9YvJkQbA$AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh" > /etc/shadow
```
**Impact**  
Shared static credentials across devices allow trivial privilege escalation through Telnet or serial access.

**Mitigation**  
Remove static passwords; generate unique credentials at first boot and disable Telnet by default.

---

#### **2. Service Configuration Exposure**
**Evidence**  
`/etc/init.d/` includes network and firewall scripts that enable Telnet and HTTP daemons on startup.

**Impact**  
Expands attack surface, especially if management ports remain open to untrusted networks.

**Mitigation**  
Restrict admin interfaces to local access or require authentication over HTTPS.

---

#### **3. BusyBox v1.37.0 Vulnerabilities**
**Evidence**
```bash
strings /bin/busybox | grep BusyBox
# BusyBox v1.37.0 (2024-05-10)
```
CVEs:
- **CVE-2024-58251** – out-of-bounds read in `awk`
- **CVE-2025-46394** – file overwrite in `tar`

**Impact**  
Malicious input to these utilities can cause data leakage or file tampering.

**Mitigation**  
Upgrade to BusyBox ≥ 1.37.2; disable unused applets and sandbox maintenance scripts.

---

#### **4. Web Management Interface**
**Evidence**  
HTML and JavaScript files found in `/www`.

**Impact**  
Possible XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities if outdated UI components remain unpatched.

**Mitigation**  
Harden HTTP endpoints; sanitize input and enforce authentication tokens.

---

#### **5. General Assessment**
No embedded credentials or keys found; firmware shows current build timestamp (Aug 2022) and recent U-Boot.  
Overall, TP-Link demonstrates relatively modern security hygiene.

---

## **2. D-Link DCS-8000LH**

### **Top Five Findings**
1. Legacy Linux 3.10 kernel (JBOOT / U-Boot).  
2. Hard-coded root hash in startup scripts.  
3. Exposed key material in `/db/verify.key`.  
4. Insecure bootloader enabling TFTP / NFS network boot.  
5. Developer paths and debug references left in production build.

---

### **Detailed Findings**

#### **1. Hard-coded Root Password**
**Evidence**
```bash
/etc/init.d/S50telnet → echo "root:$1$9YvJkQbA$AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU1:..."
```
**Impact**  
Universal credential allows full root access (CWE-259).

**Mitigation**  
Enforce password setup at first boot and remove Telnet service.

---

#### **2. Exposed Keys**
**Evidence**  
PEM-formatted files located at:
```
_dcs-8000lh.bin.extracted/_160000.extracted/db/verify.key
```
**Impact**  
Private key leakage could enable firmware signing bypass or decrypted traffic capture (CWE-320).

**Mitigation**  
Remove private keys from distributed images; store signing keys securely offline.

---

#### **3. Insecure Bootloader / Network Boot**
**Evidence**  
`binwalk` shows legacy U-Boot (2013-2014) sections and TFTP / NFS boot configuration.  
Linked CVE: **CVE-2019-14192** (NFS overflow).

**Impact**  
Allows unsigned kernels to boot, bypassing integrity checks.

**Mitigation**  
Upgrade to U-Boot ≥ 2020.01, enforce signature verification, and disable network boot protocols.

---

#### **4. Developer Traces**
**Evidence**  
Build paths such as `/home/lmeadows16/EthicalHacking/...` embedded in scripts.

**Impact**  
Reveals internal development environments, aiding targeted attacks.

**Mitigation**  
Strip debug information and rebuild in a sanitized environment.

---

#### **5. Outdated Components**
**Evidence**  
Linux 3.10 kernel and multiple SquashFS timestamps from 2017.

**Impact**  
Potential exposure to unpatched kernel-level vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**  
Rebase firmware to current LTS kernel (≥ 5.x) with active security maintenance.

---

## **3. Bare-Metal ARM ELF Firmware**

### **Top Five Findings**
1. Embedded RSA and PKCS#8 keys in `.text` section.  
2. AWS access credentials present as plaintext strings.  
3. No secure-boot or signature enforcement.  
4. Unprotected interrupt vector table at address 0x0.  
5. Statically linked binary with no filesystem separation.

---

### **Detailed Findings**

#### **1. Embedded Keys and Cloud Credentials**
**Evidence**
```bash
aws_access_key_id = AROAOB5XZUYZI7LGP7BX
aws_secret_access_key = I3QjGERPxISUFXP9x2ZJ************
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
```
**Impact**  
Full cloud-service compromise and device impersonation (CWE-321, CWE-798).

**Mitigation**  
Purge secrets from code; use per-device credentials stored in a secure element and rotate access tokens.

---

#### **2. No Secure-Boot Enforcement**
**Evidence**  
`objdump` reveals predictable vector entries at 0x0:
```
00000000: e59ff018  LDR pc,[pc,#0x18]
00000004: ea000000  B <label>
```
**Impact**  
Allows unsigned or modified firmware to execute directly from flash.

**Mitigation**  
Implement signature verification at boot and mark vector memory read-only after initialization.

---

#### **3. Lack of Filesystem / Isolation**
**Evidence**  
ELF sections only: `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, `.comment`.  
No SquashFS or config partition detected.

**Impact**  
No separation between code and data increases risk of buffer-overflow persistence.

**Mitigation**  
Introduce minimal RTOS or memory protection (MPU/MMU) and runtime integrity checks.

---

#### **4. Build Hygiene**
**Evidence**  
`.comment` section lists compiler metadata and unstripped build tags.

**Impact**  
Leaked build identifiers may disclose toolchain versions exploitable via known compiler CVEs.

**Mitigation**  
Strip comments and debug sections before release.

---

## **4. Consolidated Summary**

| # | Category | Firmware | Severity | Description | Recommended Fix |
|:-:|:----------|:----------|:----------|:-------------|:----------------|
| 1 | Hard-coded credentials | TP-Link / D-Link | High | Static root hash in init scripts | Randomize passwords; disable Telnet |
| 2 | Embedded keys / creds | ELF | Critical | RSA + AWS keys in binary | Remove and store securely |
| 3 | BusyBox CVEs | Linux firmwares | Medium | CVE-2024-58251 / 46394 (`awk`, `tar`) | Upgrade ≥ v1.37.2 |
| 4 | Exposed signing keys | D-Link | High | Private PEMs in `/db/` | Remove from image; secure build storage |
| 5 | Insecure bootloader | D-Link | High | Legacy U-Boot + network boot | Update U-Boot; enforce signatures |
| 6 | Vector table exposure | ELF | Medium | Predictable ARM vectors | Secure-boot / MPU lock |

**Overall Observation:**  
All firmware images share modern packaging formats but inconsistent security maturity.  
Hard-coded secrets, key exposure, and legacy bootloaders remain critical weaknesses.  
Applying the listed mitigations will greatly improve firmware resilience and align products with current embedded-security best practices.
